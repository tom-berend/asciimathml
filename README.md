asciimathml-ts
===========

This is a quick-and-dirty port of ASCIIMathML.js into TS and npm.

ASCIIMathML translates from ASCIIMath to MathML.  [Check this out.](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/asciimath.html)  Cheat sheet [here.](http://asciimath.org/)

As I write this, MathML is only supported in FireFox and Opera, but it looks as if Chrome support is [on the horizon.](https://mathml.igalia.com/)

The original ASCIIMathML is here: [https://github.com/asciimath/asciimathml](https://github.com/asciimath/asciimathml) 




If you want ASCIIMath in all browsers, you need to add JAX.  Refer to [this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29682207/unable-to-render-mathml-content-in-google-chrome)
